**Problem Statement**

A fundraising organization has donation transactions across multiple campaigns but lacks clear visibility into donor retention, donor lifetime value (LTV), and campaign effectiveness beyond total revenue.

**The goal of this project is to:**

* Quantify donor retention and repeat donation behavior over time
* Identify high-value donor segments using behavior-based metrics
* Measure campaign performance by long-term donor outcomes (repeat donors, LTV), not only one-time revenue
* Produce actionable recommendations to improve donor retention and future fundraising strategy

**Key Business Questions**

1. What percentage of donors are one-time vs repeat donors?
2. How long does it take donors to make a second donation?
3. Which campaigns create the most repeat donors and highest LTV donors?
4. What is LTV at 3, 6, and 12 months from a donor’s first donation?
5. When does churn happen most often after the first donation?
